# decryptron

A flexible library to create useless "decryption" animations where each character of a message can change 
independently until certain condition is met... Mostly a fun async generators exercise.

Check the online web-component example or run `deno run https://olanod.github.io/decryptron/decrypt.js [rot13 text]`.
